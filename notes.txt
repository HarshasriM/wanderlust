New Package
EJS mate -- to style our ejs templates --create layouts
npm i ejs-mate
const ejsMate = require("ejs-mate");
app.engine("ejs",ejsMate)
Do another folder in views called layouts(templates)
It is used in using layouts--- avoid repeating the code of common things in every page
Ex - navbar is used in every page we just include/partials them into our page rather than writing code again


boilerplate.ejs --- first code part in every page

here layout means template is same but we change the content over it
to include our template we use <% layout(filename) -%>
to change content in it we use <% - tagname -%>

layouts(templates) are different from includes ( files having code of repeating component in webpage)



often we should make our code moduler by splitting code into different files
