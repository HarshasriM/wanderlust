## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for creating interactive and dynamic content.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for building fast and scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.

### Templating:
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating for generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **EJS-Mate**: Layout and partial support for EJS, allowing for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) templating.

### Database:
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database program, using JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer. In Wanderlust, MongoDB is used to define schemas for listings and reviews.
- **View**: Represents the presentation layer. EJS templates are used to render the user interface.
- **Controller**: Handles the application logic and user input. Express.js controllers manage the routes and perform operations like fetching data from the database, processing it, and rendering the appropriate views.

This separation of concerns allows for organized and maintainable code, making it easier to manage and scale the project.

## Usage

- **Explore Listings**: Browse through various hosted places and destinations.
- **Host a Place**: Register and log in to host your own place by providing necessary details like title, description, price, and location.
- **Add Reviews**: Share your experience by adding reviews to existing listings.
- **View Locations**: Use the interactive map to see the exact locations of listings, helping you make informed decisions.
